# Finger-Counter
# Real-Time Finger Number Recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project uses a **pretrained hand landmark model** (via Google’s MediaPipe) and **OpenCV** to recognize and count how many fingers you're showing to your webcam in real time.

It is a beginner-friendly project focused on **gesture recognition**, **computer vision**, and **interactive AI applications** using simple logic.

## Project Objective

To detect a human hand using the webcam, identify how many fingers are raised, and display the corresponding number live on the video feed.

This is a basic practice project for computer vision using pretrained models and does not involve deep learning training.

## Installation

This project requires Python ≤ 3.10.  
If you're using a version like Python 3.11 or higher, run the code on **Google Colab** instead.

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
